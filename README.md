# Roomba-Controller
UI used to communicate with a Texas Instruments micro controller to control a "Mars Rover" roomba

# Project

As part of a final project in Embedded Systems at Iowa State University, the goal was to navigate a Roomba "Rover" in a field where we can't see the rover. Our goal was to avoid obsticals, don't fall through the floor, and navigate into a designated section on the field. This UI takes data that is sent from the Texas Instruments micro controller to create a graphical interface for the driver to navigate the field.
